# robust-registration
Robust astrometric registration and cross-match of astronomical catalogs

Code to do robust (Bayesian) cross-match of catalogs with potentially large astrometric errors.
This algorithm is described in [Tian, F. Budav√°ri, T. Basu, A. Lubow, S.H. & White, R.L. (2019) Robust Registration of Astronomy Catalogs with Applications to the Hubble Space Telescope. _The Astronomical Journal_ 158, 191](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..191T).
